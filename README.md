### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
**Graduate Stage**

**Undergradute Stage**

- [x] **Rank Test Problem with Missing Paired Data, Advisor: Prof. Xu Guo** (12/2017 - 06/2018)
   - Based on the joint asymptotic distribution of different data combination test statistic in missing paired data, a class of optimal linear weighted test statistic and maximum test statistic were given, which was compared with the test results of existing test statistic
   - From theory and simulation, respectively, it was shown that considering the other two pairs of unpaired data combinations in the test could improve the efficiency.
   - Gave test statistics with better performance in different sample cases, and applied results to analyze multiple cases
- [x] **Discrete Approximation of the Diffusion Process, Advisor: Prof. Yingzhe Wang** (06/2016 - 07/2017)
   - At present, the discrete approximation of the bounded diffusion process of the coefficient was obtained, and the discrete approximation of a class of drift coefficient unbounded diffusion processes was derived
   - Attenuated the bounded condition of the drift coefficient and constructed the transfer function
   - Applied the Skorokhod Discrete Approximation Theorem to construct a discrete Markov Chain under certain conditions
- [x] **Research on Optimal Institutional Incentive Based on Public Goods Game, Advisor: Prof. Boyu Zhang** (06/2015 - 07/2016)
   - Established the game model of the common supplies after joining the incentive mechanism of the institution
   - Explored the characteristics of the game of public goods in the institutional incentives combined with the reward and punishment system
   - Determined the distribution of reward penalty when the cost was constant, then studied the incentive cost setting to maximize the return under the optimal reward penalty allocation setting
   - Based on the results obtained, conducted numerical simulation and model verification
